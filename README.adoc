**A puzzle game where solutions are cryptographically verified - prove your work, literally.**

== Overview

proof-of-work is a puzzle game built with https://bevyengine.org/[Bevy] where players solve logic puzzles. Solutions are verified using https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3[Z3 SMT solver], ensuring that completed puzzles are mathematically valid.

=== Features

* **Bevy Engine** - Modern ECS-based game engine
* **Z3 Verification** - Solutions verified by SMT solver
* **Steam Integration** - Achievements, leaderboards, cloud saves
* **Multiplayer** - Share puzzles and compete on solution times
* **Level Editor** - Create and share custom puzzles

== Requirements

* Rust 1.70+
* Z3 solver (linked statically)
* Steam SDK (optional, for Steam features)

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/proof-of-work.git
cd proof-of-work

# Build and run (debug mode with fast compile)
cargo run

# Build release version
cargo build --release
----

== Puzzle Verification

Each puzzle solution is verified using Z3:

[source,rust]
----
// Puzzles define constraints
let puzzle = Puzzle::new()
    .add_constraint("x + y = 10")
    .add_constraint("x > y");

// Solutions are verified mathematically
let solution = player_solution();
let verified = puzzle.verify(&solver, &solution);
----

== Development

[source,bash]
----
# Run with hot reloading (dynamic linking)
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Run clippy
cargo clippy
----

== Steam Features

When built with Steam support:

* **Achievements** - Unlock achievements for completing puzzles
* **Leaderboards** - Compete for fastest solve times
* **Workshop** - Share custom puzzles
* **Cloud Saves** - Sync progress across devices

== Roadmap

* [ ] Core puzzle mechanics
* [ ] Z3 integration for verification
* [ ] Level editor
* [ ] Steam Workshop integration
* [ ] Multiplayer puzzle races
